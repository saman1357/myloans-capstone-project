# myloans-capstone-project
Displays a list of all the amounts of money or items that you have lent or borrowed (with date) as well as the sum of the lent and borrowed money amounts and their difference.
This view can also be displayed per person, i.e. everything you have lent to or borrowed from this person.
When something is returned, this entry is marked as done (with date) and is no longer displayed.
Loaned items are e.g. amount of money, book, CD, DVD, bag, piece of clothing etc. (new item types can be created).
Person names must be unique (usernames anyway).
Possibly features for later:
connect to other api for currency conversion (e.g. exchange rate â‚¬-US$)
change the language of the app
